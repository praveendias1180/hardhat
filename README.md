# ERC-20 (Standard for Fungible Tokens)

## ERC-20 (Ethereum Request for Comments 20)

The ERC-20 (Ethereum Request for Comments 20), proposed by **Fabian Vogelsteller** in November 2015, is a Token Standard that implements an API for tokens within Smart Contracts.

What is a Token?

Tokens can represent virtually anything in Ethereum:

- reputation points in an online platform
- skills of a character in a game
- lottery tickets
- financial assets like a share in a company
- a fiat currency like USD
- an ounce of gold
- and more...

**NOTE:** *ERC-721 NON-FUNGIBLE TOKEN STANDARD*
